# tflearn

This package provides high-level interface to TensorFlow in R, using the [TF.Learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tflearn/) distributed as part of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Please note -- this package is under active development and the API is subject to change while we iron out the interface.
