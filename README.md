This package provides high-level interface to TensorFlow in R, using [TF.Learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tflearn/). Note that this project is not related to [tflearn/tflearn](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn). The TF.Learn we are referring to is the `tensorflow.contrib.learn` module inside TensorFlow.
