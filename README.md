## tfestimators - R Interface to TensorFlow Estimator API

This package provides a high-level interface to TensorFlow in R, using the [Estimator](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/estimator) module distributed as part of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This package is under active development and the APIs are still subject to substantial changes. Help and documentation are also currently incomplete. The package is currently suitable for review and feedback but not for everyday use.

For more details and the design of the original Python API, please check out the paper: [TensorFlow Estimators: Managing Simplicity vs. Flexibility in High-Level Machine Learning Frameworks](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/papers/tf-estimators-kdd-paper.pdf).
