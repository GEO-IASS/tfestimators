[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/tflearn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/tflearn)

This package provides a high-level interface to TensorFlow in R, using the [TFLearn](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tflearn/) module distributed as part of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Please note -- this package is under active development and the API is subject to change while we iron out the interface.
