# Examples using TF.Learn

This directory provides basic examples of TF.Learn to get you started in building deep learning or machine learning models quickly in TensorFlow R. More tutorials in Python can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/tflearn/index.html#tf-contrib-learn-quickstart) and [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/learn). You can mimic those Python examples to write your R program.
