# R Interface to TensorFlow Estimators

![](images/tensorflow-2-100709406-large.jpg){align=right width=50%}

The **tfestimators** package is an R interface to TensorFlow Estimators, a high-level API that provides:

- Implementations of many model types including linear models, support vector machines, deep neural networks, state saving recurrent neural networks, and dynamic recurrent neural networks.

- A flexible framework for defining arbitrary new model types (Estimators)

- An Experiment API that provides distributed training and hyperparameter tuning for both canned and custom estimators.
