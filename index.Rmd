# R Interface to TensorFlow Estimators

<img src="articles/images/tensorflow-2-100709406-large.jpg" align="right" width="50%" style="margin-left: 15px;">

The **tfestimators** package is an R interface to TensorFlow Estimators, a high-level API that provides:

- Implementations of many different model types including linear models and deep neural networks. More models are coming soon such as state saving recurrent neural networks, dynamic recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, KMeans clustering, etc. 

- A flexible framework for defining arbitrary new model types as custom estimators.

- Standalone deployment of models (no R runtime required) in a wide variety of environments.

- An Experiment API that provides distributed training and hyperparameter tuning for both canned and custom estimators.

The above figure is a simplified overview of the TensorFlow Estimators interface. For more details and the design of the original Python API, please check out the white paper: [TensorFlow Estimators: Managing Simplicity vs. Flexibility in High-Level Machine Learning Frameworks](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/papers/tf-estimators-kdd-paper.pdf).

## Quick Start

### Installation

To use **tfestimators** you need to install both the R package as well as [TensorFlow](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/) itself.

First, install the tfestimators R package as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/tfestimators")
```

Then, use the `install_tensorflow()` function to install TensorFlow:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tfestimators)
install_tensorflow()
```

This will provide you with a default installation of TensorFlow suitable for getting started with the tensorflow R package. See the [article on installation](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation.html) to learn about more advanced options, including installing a version of TensorFlow that takes advantage of Nvidia GPUs if you have the correct CUDA libraries installed.



Note that the **tfestimators** package requires the very latest version of TensorFlow (v1.3), so you should be sure to install the updated version even if you may already have another earlier version installed.

### Simple Example

Let's create a simple linear regression with the `mtcars` dataset to demonstrate the use of estimators.

#### Input Function

First, some standard setup. Input to estimators is provided by an input function that returns a list containing feature and response data. You can write a custom input function or create one automatically from an R data frame, matrix, or list.

Here we define a helper function that will return an input function for a given subset of our data:

```{r}
library(tfestimators)

# return an input_fn for a given subset of data
mtcars_input_fn <- function(data) {
  input_fn(data, 
           features = c(disp, cyl), 
           response = mpg,
           batch_size = 128)
}
```

The `input_fn` method can take an R data frame or matrix along with the names of feature and response variables and automatically create an input function for it. The `batch_size` specifies the number of observations to draw for each training step.

#### Feature Columns

Next we define the feature columns for our model. Feature columns are mappings of raw input data to the data that we'll actually feed into our training, evaluation, and prediction steps. Here we create a list of feature columns containing the `disp` and `cyl` variables:

```{r}
cols <- feature_columns(
  column_numeric("disp"),
  column_numeric("cyl")
)
```

You can also define multiple feature columns at once:

```{r}
cols <- feature_columns( 
  column_numeric("disp", "cyl")
)
```

By using the family of [feature column functions](reference/index.html#section-feature-columns) we can define various transformations on the data before using it for modeling.

#### Estimator

We create the estimator by calling `linear_regressor()` function and passing it a set of feature columns: 

```{r}
model <- linear_regressor(feature_columns = cols)
```


#### Training

Next, we train the model using the `train()` function. Note that we segment `mtcars` into training and test datasets so we can evaluate the model on a different subset of data.

```{r}
# randomly segment mtcars into test and training datasets
mtcars <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars)),]
test_obs <- as.integer(0.2 * nrow(mtcars))
train <- mtcars[-(1:test_obs),]
test <- mtcars[1:test_obs,]

# train the model
model %>% train(mtcars_input_fn(train))
```

#### Evaluation

We can evaluate the model's accuracy using the `evaluate()` function (here we use the `test` dataset rather than the `train` dataset):

```{r}
model %>% evaluate(mtcars_input_fn(test))
```

#### Prediction

Finally, we generate predictions using the `predict()` function:

```{r}
obs <- mtcars[1:3,]
model %>% predict(mtcars_input_fn(obs))
```
