# R Interface to TensorFlow Estimators

<img src="images/tensorflow-2-100709406-large.jpg" align="right" width="50%" style="margin-left: 15px;">


The **tfestimators** package is an R interface to TensorFlow Estimators, a high-level API that provides:

- Implementations of many model types including linear models, support vector machines, deep neural networks, state saving recurrent neural networks, and dynamic recurrent neural networks.

- A flexible framework for defining arbitrary new model types (Estimators)

- Standalone deployment of models (no R runtime required) in a wide variety of environments.

- An Experiment API that provides distributed training and hyperparameter tuning for both canned and custom estimators.

## Quick Start

### Installation

To use **tfestimators** you need to install both the R package as well as [TensorFlow](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/) iteslf.

First, install the tfestimators R package as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/tfestimators")
```

Then, use the `install_tensorflow()` function to install TensorFlow:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tfestimators)
install_tensorflow()
```

This will provide you with a default installation of TensorFlow suitable for use with the tfestimators R package. See the [article on TensorFlow installation](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/installation.html) to learn about more advanced options, including installing a version of TensorFlow that takes advantage of Nvidia GPUs if you have the correct CUDA libraries installed.


### Simple Example

Let's create a simple linear regression with the `mtcars` dataset to demonstrate the use of estimators.

#### Input Function

First, some standard setup. Input to estimators is provided by an input function that returns a list containing feature and response data. You can write a custom input function or create one automatically from an R data frame or matrix.

Here we define a helper function that will yield an in input function for a given subset of our data:

```{r}
library(tfestimators)

# yield an input_fn for a given subset of data
mtcars_input_fn <- function(data) {
  input_fn(data, response = "mpg", features = c("drat", "cyl"))
}
```

The `input_fn` method can take an R data frame or matrix along with the names of feature and response variables and automatically create an input function for it.

#### Feature Columns

We create the estimator by calling `linear_regressor()` function and passing it a set of feature columns: 

```{r}
model <- linear_regressor(feature_columns(mtcars, c("drat", "cyl")))
```

In this case we're just passing columns from `mtcars` straight through, however by using the family of [feature column functions](reference/index.html#section-feature-columns) we can define various transformations on the data before using it for modeling.

#### Training

Next, we train the model using the `train()` function. Note that we segment `mtcars` into training and test datasets so we can evaluate the model on a differnet subset of data.

```{r}
# randomly segment mtcars into test and training datasets
mtcars <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars)),]
test_obs <- as.integer(0.2 * nrow(mtcars))
train <- mtcars[-(1:test_obs),]
test <- mtcars[1:test_obs,]

# train the model
model %>% train(mtcars_input_fn(train))
```

#### Evaluation

We can evaluate the model's accuracy using the `evaluate()` function (here we use the `test` dataset rather than the `train` dataset):

```{r}
model %>% evaluate(mtcars_input_fn(test))
```

#### Prediction

Finally, we generate predictions using the `predict()` function:

```{r}
obs <- mtcars[1:3,]
model %>% predict(mtcars_input_fn(obs))
```
